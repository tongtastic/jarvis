## Installation  
* Clone the repo to a local folder
* Duplicate `.env.example` file and rename to `.env`
* Run the following commands:  
`composer install`  
`npm install`  
`php artisan key:generate`  

You then need to add your login details for Particle and Hive to your local .env file  

So far supports Particle.io and Hive Home from British Gas  

Check back periodically, I'll be improving this as and when I have time.
